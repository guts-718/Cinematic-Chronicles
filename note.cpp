/*
 Ah, we are getting an error because we have added something to the tailwind config, but we haven't actually restart the server.
 Anything you add inside the config file, you need to restart the server.
 nav-bar
 use effect ho ya onClick we have to do --> "use client"
 go to loading.io to use the loading svg
 for the next-js image --> <Image> width and height are mendatory
 once we change the config file we have to update the server
 inside react if we want to have use styles then we have to use 2 curly braces
 use line clamp tailwind css to truncate the description to only two lines
